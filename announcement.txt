I regret to inform you guys that the above POLL has been deemed null and void. We will be conducting the poll again with some constraints this time.

Only votes from the following Players shall be taken in to account:

1. Player must have linked their account to discord.
2. Player must have 10+ hours in Classic world. 

So if you don't fall under this category, please dont bother to vote, as it shall be removed. This is to ensure that fairness to the real players of classic. 

To vote, go to  #polls channel and vote. 
The vote will last for 1 week from now. 
I will not guarantee the decision will be final from just the votes, but I can guarantee that it will  have a big impact on our decision.

**RE-POLL - CLASSIC VS PVP VS ANARCHY**
###########################

Option B has changed a little, Please read again before voting :


:regional_indicator_a: **Leave classic server as it is right now. **Do remember the features there are in classic right now(this includes admin shop, economy and others) before choosing another option.

:regional_indicator_b: **Just Enable PVP.** If someone has difficulty playing in this harsh world, one can still go to Nepal for safe and Peaceful gameplay. Everything else remains the same.

:regional_indicator_c: **Anarchy server with no land claims,** Just 100% pure survival with other players. World reset and 1.16.2 update. remember that we will not do anything if someone kills you or griefs your base. Its like 24/7 royal battle :smile: . You can use any glitches(excluding 0 tick and tnt dup) that Minecraft has to offer.

**Notes : **
1. Player must have 10+ hours in Classic world. 
2. I will not guarantee the decision will be final from just the votes, but I can guarantee that it will have a big impact on our decision.
